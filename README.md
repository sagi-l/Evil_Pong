# Evil Pong 
## Antisocial pong variant 

Evil Pong was created as an educational project with several goals in mind:
- Learning and practicing Python and OOP 
- Utilising PyGame pacakge (and others), devloping a full game with a menu system, scores, 3 difficulty levels, sound and music 
- Creating a classic game with a twist: Evil Pong uses a mechanizem which introduce random (mildly annoying) events to the game loop, hene "EVIL" 
- Use this project as a basis for another DevOps project, and run this game in Docker (WIP)
