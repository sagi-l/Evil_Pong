# Evil Pong 
## Antisocial pong variant 

Evil Pong was created as an educational project with several goals in mind:
- Learning and practicing Python and OOP 
- Utilizing the PyGame package (and others), developing a full game with a menu system, scores, 3 difficulty levels, sound and music 
- Creating a classic game with a twist: Evil Pong uses a function which introduce random (mildly annoying) events to the game loop, hence "EVIL" 
- Use this project as a basis for another DevOps project, and run this game in Docker (WIP)

## Installation:

### Prerequisites:
Clone or download the repository
Install Python3 

After you've downloaded the repository go to the directory and type in the terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You might need pip3 instead of pip 

To start the game:
```
python main.py
````

### Controls:
- Mouse for the menus 
- Keyboard keys up and down while playing the game 
- Press "P" to pause and "O" to return 
- Press Esc to return to the main menu 
- Click on the "X" to exit the game, or press Exit in the menu

### Credits 
- The game, and all of the sounds and music are created by Sagi Leibman 

## Future

- Might add a standalone exe for windows 
- Better refraction
- More music for random events 
- Docker containerization with GPU and sound support
